# Brian Lockerbie
As a recent graduate from the University of Toronto, I have successfully acquired my U of T SCS Coding Bootcamp Certificate. I am also a graduate of the school Treehouse with my Full-Stack JavaScript TechDegree. I love making websites with functional designs that are also eye-catching. I bring many certifications from UdeMy that specialize in React. I am passionate about the front-end aspects of web development.

As technology changes and evolves, so also must our skills. I firmly believe in my continuing education to adapt to any client's needs. Check out my latest projects here or my portfolio site https://brian-lockerbie.com.
